Introduction
The KMM News App is a demonstration of a Kotlin Multiplatform project where the business logic and data layers are shared between Android and iOS platforms, while the UI is implemented natively using Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI.

Architecture
This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, the NewsRepository is part of the Model layer, handling data fetching and manipulation.

View: Represents the UI of the application. On Android, the UI is implemented using Jetpack Compose, while on iOS, SwiftUI is used.

ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It exposes data from the Model to the View via StateFlow in Kotlin and @Published properties in Swift. The NewsViewModel is responsible for managing the state and handling the logic to update the UI.

Explanation of Code
NewsViewModel
The NewsViewModel class is responsible for managing the state of the news articles and the selected article. It interacts with the NewsRepository to fetch data and updates the UI via StateFlow in Kotlin (for Android) and @Published properties in Swift (for iOS).

NewsScreen
The NewsScreen displays a list of news articles. On Android, this is implemented using Jetpack Compose's LazyColumn, while on iOS, a List is used in SwiftUI. The NewsScreen also handles navigation to the DetailsScreen.

DetailsScreen
The DetailsScreen shows the details of a selected news article. It includes a TopAppBar on Android and a NavigationBar on iOS, with the title "KKM News Details Screen". The content is displayed in a scrollable Column on Android and a VStack on iOS.

NewsRepository
The NewsRepository class simulates fetching news articles. In a real application, this would involve making network requests to a news API and handling data parsing.
